      Hi everyone! I am Angelica and I am your average 22 year-old who is still
      finding her place in the world.
    </p>

    <p style={{ marginBottom: `25px` }}>
      I dedicate most of my time designing the life path that I desire because I
      strongly believe that we shape our own reality. To me, that starts by
      evaluating if the beliefs we hold and the narratives we tell ourselves is
      working for us or against us. With that said, I hope to empower others to
      do the same so that they can make conscious decisions in their daily lives
      and gain the courage to express themselves authentically.
    </p>

    <p style={{ marginBottom: `25px` }}>
      One of my favourite past times is studying people who have gained some
      level of recognition in their respective niche and emulating the results
      they have achieved. In the process, I love documenting the insights I have
      gained and sharing it because I believe that if I can help at least one
      person, I have done my job.
    </p>

    <p style={{ marginBottom: `25px` }}>
      I also aspire to build a community of self-aware individuals. One that
      stands stronger together as opposed to individually and supports one
      another in the process of reinventing our best selves. Through this
      platform, I hope to create a space where people can connect with other
      proactive individuals, discuss ideas and help elevate one another.
